# Marketplace Project

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.1.

Below are the general steps to download and run this Angular project from GitHub:

1. **Install Node.js and npm:**
   If you haven't already, you need to install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your computer. You can download them from the official website: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Install Angular CLI:**
   Angular projects are typically created and managed using the Angular CLI. Install it globally on your machine using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @angular/cli
   ```

3. **Clone the GitHub Repository:**
   Open your terminal (command prompt or PowerShell on Windows, or Terminal on macOS/Linux) and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project. Then, use the `git clone` command to clone the repository. Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL of this GitHub repository you want to clone:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

4. **Navigate to the Project Folder:**
   Change your current directory to the cloned project folder:

   ```bash
   cd <project-folder>
   ```

5. **Install Project Dependencies:**
   Inside the project folder, you need to install the project's dependencies. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

6. **Run the Development Server:**
   Angular projects typically come with a development server that allows you to run and preview the application locally. Start the development server using the following command:

   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

   By default, the Angular development server will start on `http://localhost:4200`.

7. **Access the Application:**
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200`.

Make sure you have the correct version of Angular that the project requires. Update the steps and dependencies accordingly if you are working with a different Angular version.
